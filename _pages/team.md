     name: "Richard Allen"
     bio: "Richard has been working with Oracle database technology since 1985. I learnt with Oracle V4.1.4 on MS-DOS -- when the whole stack installed on 5MB of disk! I've been an Oracle consultant working on public sector application development projects in the UK, a Product Manager responsible for Database Security in Oracle 7 and Trusted Oracle7 in Redwood Shores, and a Marketing Director for Oracle in Asia. And I had a spell at Siebel! After leaving Oracle in 1997, I have maintained my Oracle skills and watched APEX grow -- solving business problems in several large business startups that just needed a database. After returning to the UK in 2018, I have reawakened my passion for the Oracle application development world and have been a leading contributor to the Flows for APEX project."
